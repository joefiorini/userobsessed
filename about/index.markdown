# What is User Obsessed?

Software is hard. It's complex, expensive to build and to maintain. We go to great lengths to make it easier: processes like TDD/BDD, pimped out editors and entire weekends dedicated to writing code. But why are we writing the code in the first place?

With this blog I am exploring the role that developers play in defining the user experience of software. By sharing various media I come across during my research and writing my own articles I hope to share practices and tools that enable us to deliver bug-free software on time and on budget with significantly less complexity. I'm sure I will also slip in some productivity tips and code snippets because, hey, "on time" is an important part of the goal.
